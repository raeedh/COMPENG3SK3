\section{Pseudo Code}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=Matlab-editor]
% initialize singles

% divide series into 4 parts for each parallel processor

% evaluate each part using a parallel processor
p1 = increment N, divide 1/N and alternate between addition and subtraction to sum
p2 = increment N, divide 1/N and alternate between addition and subtraction to sum 
p3 = increment N, divide 1/N and alternate between addition and subtraction to sum 
p4 = increment N, divide 1/N and alternate between addition and subtraction to sum 

% sum all parts for final result
sum = p1_sum + p2_sum + p3_sum + p4_sum
